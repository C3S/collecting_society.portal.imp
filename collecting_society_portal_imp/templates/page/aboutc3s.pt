    <h1 i18n:translate="">About C3S</h1>

    <p i18n:translate="">
        C3S SCE has been founded in September 2013. Taking the legal form of a European Cooperative (SCE), it is intended to launch as the first true European collecting society for music.
    </p>

    <p i18n:translate="">
        C3S SCE will spawn a new, international and mainly online based market. It is an opportunity for musicians who will not or cannot join traditional collecting societies to monetize their work without having to give up their way of licensing. C3S SCE is about to provide standard all rights reserved licences as well as as Creative Commons licences, including all six variations.
    </p>

    <p i18n:translate="">
        Giving way to a regionally less constrained model, C3S in the long run is to offer subsidiaries in all European countries providing one streamlined licensing model.
    </p>

    <p i18n:translate="">
        Full Membership is limited to creators only to avoid distortion of discussion topics by objectives of legal successors and publishers. Enabling the introduction to music and musical production, and promoting new ways in creation of cultural works, C3S will be open to all kinds of creators: professionals, semi-professionals and the new breed of all creative users.
